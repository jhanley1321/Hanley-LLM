# Open-LLM (WIP)
A flexible multi-purpose agentic LLM chatbot suitable for working with data at scale.
Moving forward, this will be the public-free version of Hanley LLM, which is basically a better-designed version of everyting you'll see here. 
Here, I will mainly just focus on rapid prototyping and getting it to "just work." 
You can use this to get an idea of my basic skill sets with AI, or to learn things yourself. If you would like to see Hanley LLM, snippets of it at least, please reach out to me directly. 


# How to use
simply run the file on the command line for now, using main.py
```
python main.py
```

# How to set up a local LLM (will be moved to it's own repo later)

First, download Ollama. Next, You will need to look up what model you want to run locally, but for the current setup, I will be using llama2 and mxbai large; you can install them with the following commands if you haven't already:

```
ollama pull llama2
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```


If you're using a local LLM with Ollama you will need to run 
```
ollama run  <model_name>
```

If your Ollama server for some reason shuts down or needs to be restarted simply run
```
ollama server
```
