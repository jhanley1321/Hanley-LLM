# Open-LLM (WIP)
A flexible multi-propose agentic LLM chatbot suitable for working with data at scale.
There will be specialized NLP functionality built in, given its incredible performance these tasks. Our first focus will be to get this to work as a general chat bot. 


# How to use
simply run the file on the command line for now using main.py
```
python main.py
```

# How to set up a local LLM (will be moved to it's own repo later)

First, download Ollama. Next, You will need to look up what model you want to run locally, but for the current setup, I will be using llama2 and mxbai large; you can install them with the following commands if you haven't already:

```
ollama pull llama2
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```


If you're using a local LLM with Ollama you will need to run 
```
ollama run  <model_name>
```

If your Ollama server for some reason shuts down or needs to be restarted simply run
```
ollama serve
```
